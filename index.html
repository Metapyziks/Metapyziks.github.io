<a name="hi" class="anchor" href="#hi"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>hi</h1>

<p>I'm a programmer focussing on video game, AI and computer graphics related things. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at Durham University in the UK.</p>

<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h1>

<p>Here's a selection of things I've worked on recently.</p>

<a name="final-frontier-2012-2013" class="anchor" href="#final-frontier-2012-2013"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Frontier (2012-2013)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/finalfrontier.png" alt="Final Frontier"></p>

<p>Built on top of the game Garry's Mod, Final Frontier aims to be a multiplayer space combat sandbox. The game is inspired by Subset Games' FTL: Faster Than Light, but with the key difference that each player controls a single crew member, allowing for many players to cooperate in the operation of a space vessel.</p>

<p>Despite how early in development the project currently is, it has been spotted by many games journalism websites including RockPaperShotgun.com and PC Gamer. The game is also open source, and is open to contributions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="technical" class="anchor" href="#technical"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical</h3>

<p>The game is a gamemode for Garry's Mod, scripted using Lua. All code apart from some recent contributions was written by myself, along with some art assets and the level design. The remaining art was created by a friend (GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/OrangeMonkey">here</a>), who also assisted with some game design and features in the development walkthrough video series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spelunk.png" alt="SpelunkyExplorers.com"></p>

<p>This project is an unofficial online live leaderboard for the <em>Daily Challenge</em> feature in Mossmouth LLC's recently released game Spelunky.</p>

<p>Previously, the only way to view the daily leaderboards was in-game, and only the previous week could be seen. However, SpelunkyExplorers.com archives all daily leaderboards, which can be browsed all the way back to release day. The website also allows players to share links of individual leaderboard entries with friends, something that could only previously be achieved by taking a screen shot of their entry in-game.</p>

<p>Players can also sign in with their Steam account to view all of their entries, and link YouTube videos or attach comments to them.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to expand the project by providing stats, graphs, and possibly achievements awarded for achieving certain goals related to leaderboard entries. Mossmouth have also expressed an interest in the project, and have mentioned they would like to provide more data about each entry to be viewed on the site.</p>

<p>The server portion of the project is written entirely in C# by myself, on top of my web server library which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Metapyziks/WebServer">here</a>. It also makes use of my database management library, found <a href="https://github.com/Metapyziks/DatabaseTools">here</a>. The pages use jQuery for asynchronous stuff, and jQuery UI for the buttons and calender control. Most of the images used are from Spelunky, for which I have received permission.</p>

<p><img src="/images/logicsim.png" alt="Logic Sim"></p>

<p>This web application is a logic circuit simulator, built for a lecturer at my university to use when tutoring computer architecture. Although a work in progress, it already features the ability to create your own integrated circuits as components to re-use, and share your circuits or save them to be edited later.</p>

<a name="technical-2" class="anchor" href="#technical-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical</h3>

<p>The project is written entirely in Java Script, using HTML5's canvas element.</p>
