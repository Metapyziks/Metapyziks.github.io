<p>I'm a programmer focussing on video game, AI and computer graphics related things. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at Durham University in the UK.</p>

<p>Here's a selection of things I've worked on recently.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spelunk.png" alt="SpelunkyExplorers.com"></p>

<p>This project is an unofficial online live leaderboard for the <em>Daily Challenge</em> feature in Mossmouth LLC's recently released game Spelunky.</p>

<p>Previously, the only way to view the daily leaderboards was in-game, and only the previous week could be seen. However, SpelunkyExplorers.com archives all daily leaderboards, which can be browsed all the way back to release day. The website also allows players to share links of individual leaderboard entries with friends, something that could only previously be achieved by taking a screen shot of their entry in-game.</p>

<p>Players can also sign in with their Steam account to view all of their entries, and link YouTube videos or attach comments to them.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to expand the project by providing stats, graphs, and possibly achievements awarded for achieving certain goals related to leaderboard entries. Mossmouth have also expressed an interest in the project, and have mentioned they would like to provide more data about each entry to be viewed on the site.</p>
